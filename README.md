# AstroFit
A GUI designed to display 1D and 2D spectra currently under development.
A more ergonomic environment is in the works and suggestions are very welcome.
The primary tools of this code are built on PyqtGraph and PyMC3 which deal with
The visualization and MC fitting code respectively. 
An ideal for this code is to visualize the work of astronomers and create a space
that is easy to learn from as well as create robust journal ready science.
Please feel free to send me any suggestions on improvements for the code.
This is untested on anything with RAM<32GB, so please use with caution, 
particularly the fitting code which can eat up a lot of memory. 
Hopefully you will find this useful!
